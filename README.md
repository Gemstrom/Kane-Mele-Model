Hamiltonians in these programs are based on Kane C L ,  Mele E J . Quantum Spin Hall Effect in Graphene[J].  2004, 
while the definitions of z/a boundary in a general Graphene Nanoribbon arise from [1] Nakada K ,  Fujita M ,  Dresselhaus G , et al. Edge state in graphene ribbons: Nanometer size effect and edge shape dependence[J]. Physical review. B, Condensed matter, 1997, 54(24):17954-17961..
